# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Analysis:

The purpose this analysis is to ensure that the financial-backing of a non-profit organization distributes funds to third parties effectively. In the past after recieving funding, beneficiaries have simply dissappeared without a trace; effectively stealing the money and not keeping their promises. Understandably, the non profit wishes to minimize risk via machine learning. To do so, we classified data to help predict what third party entities are most likely to utilize given funds appropriately. 

## Results

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  * The variable considered the (y) variable AKA target is: "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * 
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
## Summary

Results:

There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt)
Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification (3 pt)
